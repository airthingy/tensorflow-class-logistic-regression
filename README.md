Here we solve classification problems. We use both linear regression and neural network.

## Preparing Data
Raw data was downloaded from:

```
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
```

It was cleaned up and processed using ``prepare_data.py``. Passenger survival outcome is encoded as 0 (died) and 1 (survived) in train_labels.csv and test_labels.csv.
